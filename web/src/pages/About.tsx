        CareCall is a web platform that automates outbound medical appointment
        scheduling using AI voice assistants. Built on Telnyx for
        telecommunications and Supabase for data, it lets clinic staff launch
        targeted campaigns while the AI handles live conversations, verifies
        patient identities, and books real-time slots.
